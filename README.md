## Potential Ideas for reducing waste

### Naked Market
* Analyse and Develop models for minimising waste.
* Provide daily packages for the freshest ingredient and minimal waste. All ingredients will be used in a single portion.
* Provide web ordering framework for pre-ordering ingredients.
* The main goal of waste minimisation is minimising uncertainty, if order and purchase can be prefectly predicted then theoretically there would be zero waste.

### Restaurant/Retail Level Reduction
* Develop a web management system for monitoring and recommendation for food waste.

### Household Level Reduction
* Develop a network model for cooking recipes, this will allow people to search for recipes based on the available ingredients at home.
